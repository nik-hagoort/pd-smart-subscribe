## Technical Details

### Files Structure
- `manifest.json` - Extension configuration and permissions
- `content.js` - Main script for status pages (adds checkboxes and button)
- `subscriptions.js` - Auto-fill script for subscription pages
- `background.js` - Background service worker for logging and messaging
- `popup.html` - Extension popup with usage instructions

### Permissions Required
- `storage` - To temporarily store selected service names
- `scripting` - To inject content scripts
- `host_permissions` - Access to `*.pagerduty.com` domains

### Browser Compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
1. Check that you're on a PagerDuty domain (`*.pagerduty.com`)
2. Look for service cards with the target service names
3. Check browser console for error messages (F12 â†’ Console)

### Services Not Auto-Filling
1. Ensure you're redirected to the correct subscription page
2. Check that the search dropdown is visible and functional
3. Verify the service names match exactly

### User ID Detection Issues
The extension tries multiple methods to detect your user ID:
1. Scanning page URLs for user links
2. Searching page content for user ID patterns
3. Falls back to a default ID if needed

## Customization

### Adding More Target Services
Edit the `TARGET_NAMES` array in `content.js`:

```javascript
const TARGET_NAMES = ["Employee", "Legacy (WWW)", "Timecard", "Punch In/Punch Out", "Your Service Name"];
```

### Styling Changes
Modify the CSS styles in the `content.js` and `popup.html` files to match your preferences.

## Development

### Testing
1. Make changes to the code
2. Click the refresh icon in `chrome://extensions/` for your extension
3. Navigate to a PagerDuty status page to test functionality

### Debugging

- Look for extension logs prefixed with emoji indicators
- Use the background script logs for cross-tab debugging
